London is my current favourite city in the world. Having lived in over six different cities across three different continents and travelled through many more, I feel there is some extra weight to my sentiment. Someone once said to me when I was still a newcomer to the country that England is like a cup of coffee: the more you taste, the better it gets. This is certainly true for it's capital, London.
